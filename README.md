This is a Kotlin library containing things I've needed that are generally
useful. It is *not* an attempt to replace Google Guava or Apache Commons. For
now it is constructed lazily. That is, I only add things to it when I actually
need them.

Packages include:

- com.xenomachina.common — Stuff so general it doesn't belong anywhere else.
- com.xenomachina.text — Sting and general text handling.
